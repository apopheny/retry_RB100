# What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

# An array stores data in a sequential order by index position, whereas a hash stores data by key value pairs. It is still ordered after Ruby 1.9, but the ability to access values by key or keys by value is the main utility of a hash. An array is good for its ability to mimic stack or reverse stack order due to sequentiality.
